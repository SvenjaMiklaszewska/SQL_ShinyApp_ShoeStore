## SQL_ShinyApp_ShoeStore

In our project, we created an SQL database for a shoe store, enabling the management of products, orders, complaints, and returns. 
The structure includes detailed tables, relationships ensuring data consistency, and validation mechanisms.
We also created a simple Shiny app to visualize the shoe store and everything related to orders, returns, adding, and removing products.
